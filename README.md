# FeatureSelection
A Hybrid Feature Selection Algorithm based on Large Neighborhood Search.

## Insruction of running the code:
Implementation was carried out on the Matlab 8.3. In order to run the program, you need to run the "Main.m"for both Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiersL. You can select each dataset you wish by makes it uncomment in the Dataset section, then se the parameter in the "Parameter Setting" section based on your arbitrary setting. 
You can find more information about the implemented method in my paper below:
